        <p>All Pocket Centres have the option to use the (1) CSDS-provided website, (2) their own website or (3) not have a website at all.</p>

        <p>By default, a Pocket Centre will not have a website. To use the CSDS-provided website, select the Use the CSDS-provided website option.</p>

        <p>Selecting that option will enable your CSDS-provided website. Your website slug is your Pocket Centre name by default. If you want to update your website slug to something shorter, please contact us and we'll do it for you.</p>

        <p>If you want to add a custom description on your website, add custom text on <strong>About your Pocket Centre</strong>.</p>

        <p>If you have your own website, select the <strong>Use our own website</strong> option. You'll have to provide your website address so we can add it to your email footer and Pocket Centre profile.</p>

        <p>Important: If you are using your own website, please contact us so we can assist you in displaying your courses on your website.</p>
