    <h1>Managing a course booking</h1>
    <h2>A course booking profile allows you to run a course from start to finish. If you haven't created one yet, learn how to <a href="how-to-create-a-course-booking.html">create a booking</a>.</h2>


    <ul id="user-site" class="tutorial-list wrapper active">
      <li>
        <h4>Booking statuses</h4>
        <p>Any booking starts as <strong>Awaiting approval</strong> in the system. This allows another staff to verify the details of the booking and subsequently approve it. </p>

        <p class="details">NOTE: A booking has to be approved so a confirmation email can be sent to the booking contact.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/1.png" />


        <p>Once a booking is approved, a confirmation email can be sent to the booking contact. </p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/2.png" />

        <p>If the details of the booking changes, you can always re-send a confirmation email to the booking contact.</p>

      </li>


      <li>
        <h4>Managing rooms</h4>
        <p>To manage rooms your Pocket Centre should have been configured already. If you can't find any rooms in the booking form, learn how to <a href="setting-up-your-pocket-centre.html">add rooms</a> to your Pocket Centre.</p>

        <p>To add a room, click <strong>Add room</strong>.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/4.png" />


        <p>Fill out the following information for <em><strong>every</strong></em> room. Click <strong>Save</strong> to update the booking.</p>

        <p>In specifying the time for the room, you can include the preparation and pack-up time. This will not change the booking time, but will only reflect on the room availability. </p>


        <p class="details">What do I do if I can't see any venue or rooms? Learn how to <a>configure</a> Bookings section.</p>


        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/5.png" />    

        <p>To edit/remove rooms from the booking, click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

      </li>      


      <li>
        <h4>Managing attendees</h4>
        <p>Once a course booking is created, people can register for a booking right away. A course booking does not need to be approved nor confirmed to be open for registration.</p>                           
      </li>



      <li>
        <h4>Adding an attendee manually</h4>
        <p>In situations where you may have to add a participant manually to a booking, make sure that the participant has an account with CSDS first.</p>
        <p class="details">If you need to familiarise yourself with the sign-up process, learn <a>how users register</a> for an account.</p>

        <p>To add an attendee manually, click <strong>Add attendee</strong></p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/8.png" />      

        <p>In the pop-up that appears, enter the name of the participant you want to add.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/10.png" />      

        <p>Click the participant's name in the results area to add them in the booking.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/12.png" />      

        <p>Choose a course price for the participant you are adding. Then click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/13.png" />      

        <p>And you're done. Just take note that an attendee that has been added manually is considered confirmed (approved and paid).</p>   
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/14.png" />      
     
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Approving course registrations</h4>
        <p>When someone registers for a course, they receive an email that they need to be approved first. Your Pocket Centre contact also gets an email every time someone registers for any of your Pocket Centre courses. </p>

        <p class="details">Learn how to <a>update your Pocket Centre contact details</a>.</p>
        <p>This is how a participant who needs approval appears in the attendees section.</p>    
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/15.png" />      

        <p>To approve a registration, select the participant you are approving.<br />Yes, you can select multiple participants at once.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/16.png" />      

        <p>Then click <strong>Approve registration</strong>.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/17.png" />      

        <p>Once a participant is approved, they will get an email letting them know that someone from your Pocket Centre will contact them to arrange payment. That participant's booking status will change to <strong>Awaiting Payment</strong>.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/18.png" />      
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Can I decline a participant's registration?</h4> 
        <p>Yes. Just select the participant you want to decline. From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Decline registration</strong>. An email is sent to the participant informing them about this action.</p>    

        <h4>Can I approve someone that I declined before?</h4> 
        <p>As long as the course is not yet full, yes you can. If a participant has previously been marked as Paid, their status will go from <strong>Declined</strong> to <strong>Confirmed</strong> right away.</p>              
      </li>      

      <li>
        <h4>Marking a participant as paid</h4>
        <p>Marking a participant as paid confirms their booking to the course. Once marked, they get an email confirming their registration with the details of the eLearning (if applicable) and their face-to-face course.</p>

        <p>To mark a participant as paid, select the participant you want to mark.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/19.png" />   

        <p>From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Mark as paid</strong>.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/20.png" />              

        <p>Their status should change from <strong>Awaiting Payment</strong> to <strong>Confirmed</strong>.</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/21.png" />   
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Can I mark a participant as not paid?</h4> 
        <p>Yes. Select the participant you want to mark as not paid from the list. From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Mark as not paid</strong>. No email is sent to the participant when you do this.</p>       
      </li>


      <li>
        <h4>Removing an attendee</h4>
        <p>To remove an attendee, select the participant you want to mark as not paid from the list. From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Remove</strong>. No email is sent to the participant when you do this.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Can I add an attendee that I have removed before?</h4>
        <p>Yes. Please refer to <a>Adding an attendee manually</a>.</p>
      </li>



      <li>
        <h4>Reserved spots</h4>
        <p>Reserved spots are used to limit the number of participants that can register to the maximum number of participants minus the reserved spots. Remember that a reserved spot is considered "confirmed". </p>
        <p>Only add a reserved spot if you can guarantee that the participant will pay.</p>

        <p>To add a reserved spot, click <strong>Add reserved spot</strong>.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/7.png" />      

        <p>The reserved spot should appear at the top of the list.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/8.png" />                             

        <p>To remove a reserved spot, just select a reserved spot you want to remove then click <strong>Actions</strong> and select <strong>Remove</strong>. This action will immediately remove the selected reserved spot. </p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/9.png" />          
      </li>



      <li>
        <h4>Exporting attendees list</h4>
        <p>To export a list, select the participants you want included and from the actions dropdown, click <strong>Export as spreadsheet</strong>. This will download a CSV file that you can open in your preferred spreadsheet software.</p>

        <p>Here's a sample of what the spreadsheet contains:</p>
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/22.png" />          

        
      </li>


      <li>
        <h4>Marking course outcomes</h4>
        <p>Course certificates are generated only when participant outcomes are recorded. eLearning certificates are generated automatically when the participant completes them and can be accessed through their own account.</p>

        <p>Marking course outcomes is a two-step process. The first step is to record a participant's attendance. To do this, select a participant and from the actions dropdown click <strong>Participant outcomes</strong>.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/23.png" />          

        <p>In the modal that appears, select whether the participant has attended or not. Then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/25.png" />                  

        <p>If a participant attended, a course outcome also has to be recorded. Comments are optional. Click <strong>Save</strong> to set the participant outcome. </p>

        <p class="details">Depending on the course, the options available are <strong>Passed</strong>, <strong>Passed (Provisional)</strong>, <strong>Failed</strong>, <strong>Completed</strong> and <strong>Not completed</strong>. </p>

        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/26.png" />                  

        <p>Upon saving, participants who passed (including the provisional) will get access to their course certificates thru their accounts.</p>
        
        <img src="images/managing-a-booking/27.png" />                  

        
      </li>


      <li>
        <h4>Adding faculty</h4>
        <p>Adding faculty is a great way to roster schedule and availability of your staff in the Pocket Centre. Note that all faculty must have an account with CSDS and have the Faculty role.</p>
        <p><a>Contact us</a> if you can't find a faculty in your list.</p>
        <p>To add a faculty, click <strong>Add faculty</strong>.</p>
