        <h4>Attendee registration</h4>
        <p>In most cases, attendess will register themselves via the course profile page, where they can choose a location and date suitable for them.</p>
      </li>
        <li>
        <h4>Adding an attendee manually</h4>
        <p>In cases where you may need to add an attendee manually to a course booking, please make sure that the attendee has an account with CSDS first.</p>
        <!--
        <p class="details">If you need to familiarise yourself with the sign-up process, learn <a>how users register</a> for an account.</p>

      <br>
        <p>To add an attendee manually, click <strong>Add attendee</strong></p>

        <h4>Approving course registrations</h4>
        <p>Upon registration for a course, user's receive an email to let them know their registration is Pending Approval. An email is also sent to your Pocket Centre's contact email address to inform you of the registration requiring approval.</p>

        <p>Here is an an example of what 'Pending Approval' looks like in your attendees list.</p>    
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/15.png" />      

        <p>To approve a registration, select the checkbox next to the attendee you are approving.<br />Yes, you can select multiple attendees at once.</p>

        <h4>Reserved spots</h4>
        <p>Reserved spots are used to limit the number of attendees that can register to the maximum number of attendees minus the reserved spots. Remember that a reserved spot is considered "confirmed". </p>

      <!-- Managing attendees -->
      <li>
        <h4>Marking course outcomes</h4>
        <p>Course certificates are generated only when attendee outcomes are recorded. eLearning certificates are generated automatically when the attendee completes them and can be accessed through their own account.</p>

        <p>Marking course outcomes is a two-step process. The first step is to record an attendee's attendance. To do this, select an attendee and from the actions dropdown click <strong>Participant outcomes</strong>.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/23.png" />          

        <p>In the popup that appears, select whether the attendee has attended or not. Then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/25.png" />                  

        <p>If an attendance is marked, a course outcome also has to be recorded. Comments are optional. Click <strong>Save</strong> to set the attendee outcome. </p>

        <p class="details">Depending on the course, the options available are <strong>Passed</strong>, <strong>Passed (Provisional)</strong> and <strong>Failed</strong>. </p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/26.png" />                  

        <p>Upon saving, attendees who passed (including the provisional) will get access to their course certificates thru their accounts.</p>
        
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/27.png" />                          
      </li>

      <!-- Managing attendees -->
      <li>
        <h4>Adding faculty</h4>
        <p>Adding faculty is a great way to roster schedule and availability of your staff in the Pocket Centre. Note that all faculty must have an account with CSDS and have the Faculty role.</p>
        <p><a href="https://csds.qld.edu.au/contact/">Contact us</a> if you can't find a faculty in your list.</p>
        <p>To add a faculty, click <strong>Add faculty</strong>.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/28.png" />

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/32.png" />            

        <p>Repeat the process to add more faculty. To remove a faculty click <strong>Remove</strong>. Take note that removing a faculty in a booking, does not delete their account.</p>
