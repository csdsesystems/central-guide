        <h4>Managing attendees</h4>
        <p>Once a course booking is created, people can register for a booking right away. A course booking does not need to be approved nor confirmed to be open for registration.</p>                           
      </li>

        <h4>Adding an attendee manually</h4>
        <p>In situations where you may have to add a participant manually to a booking, make sure that the participant has an account with CSDS first.</p>
        <p class="details">If you need to familiarise yourself with the sign-up process, learn <a>how users register</a> for an account.</p>

        <p>To add an attendee manually, click <strong>Add attendee</strong></p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/8.png" />      

        <p>In the pop-up that appears, enter the name of the participant you want to add.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/10.png" />      

        <p>Click the participant's name in the results area to add them in the booking.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/12.png" />      

        <p>Choose a course price for the participant you are adding. Then click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/13.png" />      

        <p>And you're done. Just take note that an attendee that has been added manually is considered confirmed (approved and paid).</p>

        <h4>Approving course registrations</h4>
        <p>When someone registers for a course, they receive an email that they need to be approved first. Your Pocket Centre contact also gets an email every time someone registers for any of your Pocket Centre courses. </p>

        <p class="details">Learn how to <a>update your Pocket Centre contact details</a>.</p>
        <p>This is how a participant who needs approval appears in the attendees section.</p>    
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/15.png" />      

        <p>To approve a registration, select the participant you are approving.<br />Yes, you can select multiple participants at once.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/16.png" />      

        <p>Then click <strong>Approve registration</strong>.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/17.png" />      

        <p>Once a participant is approved, they will get an email letting them know that someone from your Pocket Centre will contact them to arrange payment. That participant's booking status will change to <strong>Awaiting Payment</strong>.</p>
        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/18.png" />

        <h4>Can I decline a participant's registration?</h4> 
        <p>Yes. Just select the participant you want to decline. From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Decline registration</strong>. An email is sent to the participant informing them about this action.</p>    

        <h4>Can I approve someone that I declined before?</h4> 
        <p>As long as the course is not yet full, yes you can. If a participant has previously been marked as Paid, their status will go from <strong>Declined</strong> to <strong>Confirmed</strong> right away.</p>              
      </li>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/21.png" />   
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Can I mark a participant as not paid?</h4> 
        <p>Yes. Select the participant you want to mark as not paid from the list. From the actions dropdown, click <strong>Mark as not paid</strong>. No email is sent to the participant when you do this.</p>

        <h4>Reserved spots</h4>
        <p>Reserved spots are used to limit the number of participants that can register to the maximum number of participants minus the reserved spots. Remember that a reserved spot is considered "confirmed". </p>
        <p>Only add a reserved spot if you can guarantee that the participant will pay.</p>

        <p>To add a reserved spot, click <strong>Add reserved spot</strong>.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/7.png" />      

        <p>The reserved spot should appear at the top of the list.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/8.png" />

        <h4>Exporting attendees list</h4>
        <p>To export a list, select the participants you want included and from the actions dropdown, click <strong>Export as spreadsheet</strong>. This will download a CSV file that you can open in your preferred spreadsheet software.</p>

        <p>Here's a sample of what the spreadsheet contains:</p>

        <h4>Marking course outcomes</h4>
        <p>Course certificates are generated only when participant outcomes are recorded. eLearning certificates are generated automatically when the participant completes them and can be accessed through their own account.</p>

        <p>Marking course outcomes is a two-step process. The first step is to record a participant's attendance. To do this, select a participant and from the actions dropdown click <strong>Participant outcomes</strong>.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/23.png" />          

        <p>In the modal that appears, select whether the participant has attended or not. Then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/25.png" />                  

        <p>If a participant attended, a course outcome also has to be recorded. Comments are optional. Click <strong>Save</strong> to set the participant outcome. </p>

        <p class="details">Depending on the course, the options available are <strong>Passed</strong>, <strong>Passed (Provisional)</strong>, <strong>Failed</strong>, <strong>Completed</strong> and <strong>Not completed</strong>. </p>

        <img src="../images/managing-a-booking/26.png" />                  

        <p>Upon saving, participants who passed (including the provisional) will get access to their course certificates thru their accounts.</p>

        <h4>Adding faculty</h4>
        <p>Adding faculty is a great way to roster schedule and availability of your staff in the Pocket Centre. Note that all faculty must have an account with CSDS and have the Faculty role.</p>
